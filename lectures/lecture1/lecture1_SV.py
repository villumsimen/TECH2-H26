Part 2, Lecture 1

Implement and test an argmax() function that returns the location of a maximum.

Tasks
-----

1.  Implement a function argmax() that takes a sequence of numbers and returns
    the index (position) of the maximum element.

2.  Test the function with the following sequence of numbers:
    [2, 3, -1, 7, 4]

3.  Add error handling if an empty sequence is passed. Test the function with an
    empty sequence.

4.  Use the notebook lecture1.ipynb to benchmark your implementation
    against NumPy's argmax().
